# Benchmark 6. "Model-based design reviews"

This is a template that details the expected Minimum Viable Content of a benchmark including the documentation and the data.

## Introduction

Today, the most common practice to coordinate content consists in sharing screenshots of models in a slide deck [7], which makes the understanding of models and the identification of relationships between the models difficult [7], [8]. Research studies try to improve design reviews by proposing new mediation technologies, but they show a lack of rigour in the validation phase. This repository proposes an open benchmark exercise for comparing model-based design reviews.

- Type of research : quantitative
- Main discipline(s) it contributes to : engineering design, especially model-based systems engineering
- The goal of the study : to improve design, especially model-based design reviews 
- The type of contribution : empirical to practice
- Objects to validate : tools for reviewing model-based designs.
- Expected results : a cartography of strengths and weeknesses of tools for reviewing model-based designs.

## Glossary

- Model-Base Design (synonyms: Model-Centric Design, Model-Based Systems Engineering, Model-Centric Systems Engineering, Model-Based Engineering, etc.): formalized application of modeling to support system requirements, design, analysis, verification and validation activities beginning in the conceptual design phase and continuing throughout development and later life cycle phases (INCOSE, 2007)
- View (synonyms: viewpoint, perspective, cognitive view): result of an interpretation process that starts from the observation of an existing object, or from the imagination of a planned object, which then leads to the creation to a set of models according to a stakeholder viewpoint, that is, a set of particular concerns in regards to the real or planned
object.
- Model (synonym: representation, intermediate object, intermediate representation): a subjective partial description of an existing or planned technical object, which results from an abstraction according to a particular view, and that is put forward as a basis for some purpose, such as calculations, communication, etc.

## Goals

Specify the common set of goals that the competing solutions pursue:
- The solution shall enable to share a common understanding of intermediate representations.
- The solution shall enable to trace intermediate representations vertically, that is, from one systemic level to another (top-down and bottom-up).
- The solution shall enable to trace intermediate representations vertically, that is, throughout the product development phases and, in a more general way, throughout the system life cycle phases.

# Solutions

In the folder named [solutions](), you should collect the competing solutions.

## Measures of Performance

Understanding of model-based design with access to the design review environment:
1.	What is the ID of the requirements satisfied by the assembly (from the CAD model) “TelescopeAssembly”?
2.	What is the name of the functions needed by the stakeholder “PowerGrid”?
3.	What is the name of the stakeholder which needs the requirement “Req Manual-ly pilot inclination position” to be met?
To avoid answering all the questions in a row, they are displayed one by one. 

Understanding of model-based design with access to the design review environment:
1.	What are the stakeholders of the telescope?
2.	What are the sub-logical blocks (of the behaviour model) of the telescope?
3.	What are the stakeholders of the sub-system “MechanicalSubSystem” (in the architecture model)? 

Usability: SUS

Cognitive load: NASA/TLX
